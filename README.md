# Bioinformatics
Some labs that I have done for CSCI-B 363 at Indiana University.  Labs include De Bruijin graphs, global and local DNA sequence alignment and more.  Most of the code here was done in C++. </br>

An important note to those who are CURRENTLY TAKING THIS CLASS: </br>
I have no problem if you want to use my code as simply a guide to help your learning. However, I absolutely DO NOT condone the use of plagiarism or submission of work that is not your own. I will not be held responsible for those who choose to copy and paste my code for submission. Thank you!
